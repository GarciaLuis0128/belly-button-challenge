# belly-button-challenge

This project is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Features

- Displays top 10 OTUs found in an individual as a horizontal bar chart.
- Displays a bubble chart showing each sample.
- Displays sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- Allows users to select different samples from a dropdown menu to update all plots and metadata simultaneously.

## Technologies Used

- D3.js: Used for data visualization.
- Plotly.js: Used for creating interactive plots.
- HTML/CSS: Used for the layout and styling of the dashboard.
- JavaScript: Used for scripting and interactivity.

## How to Use

1. Visit the deployed app [here](https://username.github.io/belly-button-challenge).
2. Select a sample ID from the dropdown menu to view the corresponding data.
3. Explore the horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, and sample metadata displayed on the page.
